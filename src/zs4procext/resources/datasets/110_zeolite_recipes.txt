Finally, the resultant gel was transferred into a stainless-steel Te\ue104on-lined autoclave and crystallized at 180 \x03C for 48 h. The obtained solid product was \ue103ltered, washed with distilled water until the pH of the \ue103ltrate was 7, and then dried at 105 \x03C overnight. The resultant product was a\ue09derwards calcined at 550 \x03C for 6 h to remove the organic templates. The obtained sample was dened as NaZSM-5 zeolite. HZSM-5 zeolite was obtained by ion-exchanging NaZSM-5 zeolite two times with 1 mol L 1 NH4Cl solution (liquid/solid ¼ 10 mL g 1) at 80  C for 4 h. The solid sample was ltered, dried at 105  C overnight, and calcined at 550  C for 6 h.
Nano-sized silicalite-1 and NaAlO2 were added into the TPAOH solution and stirred for 10 min. The final molar composition was 60SiO2 : 11TPAOH: 1Al2O3. After being mixed adequately, the mixture was hydrothermally treated in a stainless steel autoclave at 443 K under mild rotation for 72 h. Thereafter, the Na ZSM-5 sample was obtained by repeating the above procedure in section 2.1 about the collection of the solid product of silicalite-1. To obtain H-form zeolites, Na-ZSM-5 samples were ion exchanged with 0.8 M NH4Cl aqueous solution at 353 K three times. Then, the samples were filtered and dried for 12 h at 373 K, followed by calcination in static air at 823 K for 6 h.
Desilicated with 1 M NaOH solution at 85 ◦C for 1 h, under atmospheric pressure. 25 ml of NaOH solution was heated up to 85 ◦C in a ﬂask combined with reﬂux, then 3 g of the calcined (at 400 ◦C) zeolite was added and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 1 h. After modiﬁcation, the ZSM-5 zeolite samples were transformed into ammonium forms by fourfold ion exchange with 0.5 M ammonium nitrate (2 h) without calcinations in between ion-exchange procedures. Finally, samples were transformed into the hydrogen forms by calcinations in vacuum at 550 ◦C.

Stir the resulting mixture at room temperature for 2 days. Recover the white precipitate by filtration, wash with acetonitrile and diethyl ether, and dry under a vacuum to obtain pure 1,4-TDEAPI2.
200 ml NaOH solution with a concentration of 0.75 M was kept at a temperature of 55 °C in a flask with a reflux condenser using a water bath, and 20 g of the calcined sample was added into the heated NaOH solution. The slurry was stirred at the fixed temperature for a treatment time of 2 h. Subsequently, the slurry was cooled down immediately and filtered. Dilute HNO3 was employed to neutralize the left OH- that adhered on the zeolite. Finally, all the sodium type ZSM-5 samples, including the alkali-treated and untreated, were ion-exchanged with 0.8 M NH4NO3 solution at 80 °C for three times to replace Na+ by NH4+, and followed by washing and drying. The HZSM-5 zeolites were obtained by subsequent calcinations at 520 °C in air for 3 h.
Some samples were subsequently acid treated in 0.020.1 M aqueous HCl (1 g zeolite per 100 cm3 of solution) at 338 K for 6 h. Prior to acidity characterization and catalytic testing, the zeolites were converted into the protonic form by three consecutive ion exchanges in 0.1 M aqueous NH4NO3 (298 K, 12 h, 1 g zeolite per 100 cm3 of solution), followed by calcination as described for the parent zeolite.
The initial gel for the template-free synthesis of ZSM-5 zeolite was prepared by mixing a solution of sodium silicate (Na2SiO3, 28% SiO2, Merck), NaOH (98%, Merck), aluminum sulfate (Al2(SO4)3 18H2O, Merck), H2SO4 (98%, Merck) and deionized (DI) water with the molar ratios of 16Na2O : 31SiO2 : Al2O3 : 2400 H2O : 16H2SO4 (composition A) and 28Na2O : 62SiO2 : Al2O3 : 2400 H2O : 16H2SO4 (composition B). These initial gels were mixed strongly and aged at room temperature for some time. Then the prepared gels were transferred to a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and hydrothermally treated at 185 °C under stirring at 200 rpm for a range of reaction times. After the hydrothermal synthesis, the prepared ZSM-5 zeolites were filtered, washed with DI water, and then dried at 120 1C overnight. The NaZSM-5 was changed to HZSM-5 by the ion exchange method. The ion exchange was done three times with a solution of NH4NO3 at 80 1C for 2 h. Then the samples were dried at 120 1C overnight and calcined at 550 1C for 4 h.
To prepare the feed gel, 2.78 g of NaAlO2 was dissolved in a solution containing 0.035 g of NaOH and 22.3 g of DI water. Next, 30.19 g of Na2SiO3 silicate solution was slowly added to the sodium aluminate solution at a rate of 60 drops/min under stirring for 30 min. The obtained feed gel was then added to the wood-containing seed gel and stirred continuously for 30 min. The resultant mixture was aged for 24 h at room temperature without stirring, then heated at 90 °C for 24 h. After cooling down, the solid products, including the wood–zeolite composite and zeolite powder, were separated, repeatedly washed with DI water using sonication until the pH of the washing water was approxi mately 8, and dried at 100 °C overnight.

In these gels, the weight ratio of SiO2/P123 was 4. Then the mixed solutions were assembled for 20 h at 30 °C. After that, the obtained products were transferred into Teﬂon autoclaves for crystallization at 100 °C for 48 h. After ﬁltration, washing, and drying, the as-synthesis products were calcined at 550 °C for 5 h to remove the P123 and SDS.

Tetrapropylammonium hydroxide (TPAOH, 40%, Alfa Aesar) was used as an organic structure-directing agent (OSDA) for the synthesis. TPAOH was diluted with deionized (DI) water, followed by the dropwise addition of the silica source, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), under continuous stirring. The solution was stirred overnight at room temperature to yield a clear solution, which was combined with Pt/Al2O3 particles (1 wt % of solution) in a Teﬂon-lined stainless-steel autoclave (Parr Instruments). The autoclave was heated in a ThermoFischer Precision 3050 series gravity oven at 100 °C under constant rotation (30 rpm) to prevent sedimentation of core particles. After 24 h, the autoclave was removed from the oven and quenched to room temperature. The seeded core or P(0.05)-AS particles were isolated from the mother liquor by ﬁltration (Filter Paper, Qualitative, 415, VWR) and washing with DI water.
A mixture of 14.9 g of ethanol and 16.9 g of a TPAOH solution was prepared in a perﬂuoroalkoxy alkane (PFA) container (100 mL capacity) and then stirred for 10 min. We subsequently added 12.1 g of TEOS dropwise to obtain ﬁnal TEOS:TPAOH:ethanol:H2O molar ratio of 1:0.36:5.57:12.11. The resulting solution was aged at 30 °C for 24 h before 21.5 g aliquots of it were transferred to a Teﬂon-lined autoclave (180 mL capacity) to undergo a subsequent hydrothermal reaction in an oven under conventional heating at 135 °C for 6 h. Following the completion of the hydrothermal synthesis process, the zeolite suspensions (21.5 g) were mixed with 2.96 g of TWEEN 80 as a surfactant. The mixtures were then stirred at 30 °C for 24 h to form cast suspensions.

Solution B was prepared by adding 0.2 g AIP and 13.0 g TEOS in 30.0 mL deionized water and stirring for 4 h at 40 ◦C. Afterwards, solution A was slowly dropped into solution B and vigorously stirred for another 12 h at 60 ◦C. Then, 0.15 g ZSM-5 seeds was added to the above mixture and vigorously stirred for 0.5 h. The obtained suspension was transferred into a Teﬂon-lined autoclave, and crystallization of zeolites was conducted at 175 ◦C for 72 h. After that, the obtained sample was washed repeatedly with DI water and ﬁltered. Then, it was successively dried at 100 ◦C for 12 h. To remove the organic contents, the obtained ﬁlter cakes were calcinated at 600 ◦C in air in a static mufﬂe furnace for 6 h. To obtain the H type ZSM-5 samples, ion exchange was processed three times in aqueous NH4Cl solution (1 mol/L, m(liquid)/m(solid) = 30) under stirring at 80 ◦C for 4 h, followed by calcination at 600 ◦C in air for 4 h.

Approximately 330 mg of parent zeolite was vigorously stirred in 10 ml 0.2 M NaOH solution at temperatures in the range 308–358 K and a treatment duration of 15–120 min. The zeolite suspension was then cooled down immediately using an ice bath. The remaining product was ﬁltered, care fully washed until neutral pH and ﬁnally dried at 373 K. The alkaline-treated samples were converted into the H-form by three consecutive exchanges in 0.1 M NH4NO3 solution fol lowed by air-calcination at 823 K for 5 h.
The conventional ZSM-5 zeolite was synthesized under hydrothermal conditions with molar relations at 300SiO2/Al2O3/117OSDA/Na2O/9610H2O. In a typical run, 0.055 g of NaAlO2 and 40.0 g of TPAOH (20 wt.%) were added into 26.0 g of distilled water. After fully dissolved, 6.0 g of solid silica gel was added. After stirring for 4 h, the ﬁnally obtained gels were transferred into an autoclave and heated at 180 ◦C for 48 h, followed by calcination at 550 ◦C for 5 h. The H-form of the samples was obtained by ion-exchange with NH4Cl solution (1 M) at 80 ◦C for 2 h. The ion-exchange procedure was repeated twice, followed by calcination at 550 ◦C for 5 h.
3 g of TPA@ST(90 °C) was mixed with 3 g of aqueous 0.1 M TPAOH solution and transferred to a PTFE-lined autoclave (100 mL) for further crystallization at 170 °C for 2−24 h. After the synthesis, the reaction mixture was centrifuged to separate the solid product (from the liquid), which was then washed using deionized water 3 times and dried at 100 °C in an oven overnight. After drying, the solid sample was calcined at 550 °C for 6 h.
39.52 g of H2O, 7.27 g of TBAOH, 0.05 g of NaAlO2, 0.31 g of NaOH, and 9.68 g of JN-40 were added sequentially, and the mixture was then stirred for 24 h at 30 ºC. The molar composition of resulted gel mixture was 9 TBAOH: 0.3214 Al2O3: 90 SiO2: n H2O: 12.897 NaOH (n = 3600). The synthesis gel was sealed into a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and synthesized at 85 °C for 48 h, then at 120 °C for 48 h, and finally at 165 °C for 20 h under rotation of 15 rpm.
In the typical synthesis, 8.4 g of tetrapropylammonium bromide (TAPBr), 0.6 g of Sodium Aluminate (NaAlO2), and 2.4 g of Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH) were dissolved in 450 ml of deionized water (DW). Then, 25.71 g of Tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) were added and stirred for one hr. The solution was transferred to a 500 ml Teﬂon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and heated at 175  C for 72 h. The auto clave was allowed to cool to room temperature and the products were washed with deionized water thoroughly, dried at 120  C for 12 h. Thus, synthe sized zeolites were powdered using pestle and mor tar, further calcinated at 500  C for 2 h in a mufﬂe furnace to obtain ZSM-5 nanostructures.
Mix 20.48 g of a TEAOH solution, 0.106 g of NaCl, and 0.288 g of KCl with 9.32 g of deionized water by magnetic stirring for 10 min before adding 20.49 g of TEOS into the mixture. After 6 h of continuous stirring, TEOS hydrolyzed completely, and the mixture became clear. The [Pd(EDA)2]Cl2 solution was prepared by dissolving 0.05 g of PdCl2 in the mixture of 0.5 mL of ethylenediamine and 8 mL of H2O. The resulted [Pd(EDA)2]Cl2 solution was then added dropwise into the above mixture, and no precipitates were observed under stirring for 30 min, forming clear solution A. At the same time, 0.066 g of NaOH and 0.358 g of NaAlO2 were added into 4 g of deionized water, and the mixture was continuously stirred until forming clear solution B, which was then added dropwise into solution A, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 10 min to form a white suspension. The reaction gel was then obtained by vacuum evaporation of the reaction mixture at 70 °C for 1 h to remove water and ethanol. Finally, the reaction gel was transferred into a 25 mL Teflon lined stainless-steel autoclave and crystallized in a convection oven under static pressure at 200 °C for 3 h. The as synthesized solids were centrifuged, rinsed several times with water, and then dried overnight at 80 °C. The product was heated in the air at 550 °C (5 °C/min) for 4 h and then reduced at 200 °C (5 °C/min) for 2 h in a 10% H2/Ar flow (100 mL/min).
The secondary growth of a ZSM-5 shell over P(0.05)-AS seeds was accomplished using a solution with the following molar composition: 10 TPAOH/31.5 TEOS/1 NaAlO2/1483 H2O. The ZSM-5 growth solution was prepared by adding an appropriate amount of TEOS (dropwise) to a solution containing TPAOH, NaAlO2 (Alfa Aesar), and DI water. The solution was stirred at room temperature overnight. The formation of a ZSM-5 shell was carried out by adding the seeded core (1 wt % P(0.05)-AS) to the growth solution. The resulting mixture was then placed in a Teﬂon-lined stainless-steel autoclave that was heated at 180 °C under rotation for 48 h. To obtain a complete coverage of ZSM-5 shell around the core, we employed a secondary growth step involving the resuspension of solids recovered from the ﬁrst batch in a fresh growth solution and repeating the same synthesis procedure for a second time at the same synthesis conditions (180 °C, 48 h). The resulting CS particles were recovered by vacuum ﬁltration and washing with DI water. The sample was allowed to dry, followed by calcination at 550 °C for 6 h with a temperature ramp rate of 5 °C/h to remove the OSDA. The resulting Na-form zeolite was triple exchanged with a 0.5 M solution of NH4NO3 (Sigma Aldrich) at 80 °C for 1 h per cycle with sequential ﬁltration and washing. The recovered solids were dried at 60 °C and 
200 ml NaOH solution with a concentration of 0.5 M was kept at a temperature of 55 °C in a flask with a reflux condenser using a water bath, and 20 g of the calcined sample was added into the heated NaOH solution. The slurry was stirred at the fixed temperature for a treatment time of 5 h. Subsequently, the slurry was cooled down immediately and filtered. Dilute HNO3 was employed to neutralize the left OH- that adhered on the zeolite. Finally, all the sodium type ZSM-5 samples, including the alkali-treated and untreated, were ion-exchanged with 0.8 M NH4NO3 solution at 80 °C for three times to replace Na+ by NH4+, and followed by washing and drying. The HZSM-5 zeolites were obtained by subsequent calcinations at 520 °C in air for 3 h.

The gel was submitted to hydrothermal treatment in a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave of 43 mL of capacity. The crystallization was performed at 150 °C for 48 h. The product was recovered, filtered and washed with deionized water. Subsequently, the crystallization products were dried at 100 °C for 12 h.
Heat 300 ml of 0.05 M NaOH aqueous solution to 358 K in a polyethylene flask with a reflux condenser using a water bath. Add 4 g of ZSM-5 and keep the solution at that temperature while stirring. After 30 min, cool down the slurry immediately using an ice bath and filter.
An ordered mesoporous silica was synthesized using the surfactant 1,2-dimethyl-3-hexadecyl-1H-imidazol-3-ium bromide (C16IMZ).37 C16IMZ was dissolved in deionized water at room temperature. Sodium silicate (Merck, SiO2 27.0%, Na2O 8.0%) was added dropwise to this solution under stirring. The resulting gel was aged for 2 h at room temperature and had a molar composition of 0.2 C16IMZ : 2.7 Na2O : 10 SiO2 : 300 H2O. Subsequently, the gel was transferred into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave and placed in a rotation oven for 6 days at 115 °C (50 rpm). The resulting solid was thoroughly washed with deionized water and dried overnight at 110 °C. Next, the organics were removed by calcination in air for 6 h at 550 °C (1 °C min−1).
0.3 g NaOH was dissolved in 23 mL deionized water under vigorous stirring at room temperature. After this, 0–3 g TMAdaOH was added under stirring and stirring was continued for 1 h; then, ZSM-5 was added to this solution and stirred for 3 h. The resulting mixture was transferred into an autoclave and heated at 130–160 1C for 0–24 h under static conditions. The solid product was collected, washed, dried at 100 1C for 12 h, and finally calcined at 550 1C for 12 h to remove the organic template. The samples were ion exchanged with 0.5 mol L 1 NH4NO3 solution at 80 1C to obtain the NH4-form of SSZ-13 and then transformed into the H-form by calcination at 500 1C for 4 h.
75 mL of ultrapure water was added to the aged medium under agitation, after which the mixture was transferred into 23 mL Teflon lined autoclave reactors (Figure 14). The autoclave reactors were placed in a hot air oven at 140 °C in order for the hydrothermal treatment stage to commence. The hydrothermal stage proceeded for 48 hours. After hydrothermal treatment the products were separated from the post synthesis supernatant after which it was washed and dried.

After 30 min of vigorous stirring, 11.956 g of EDA was added, causing exothermic heating of the mixture. Another 30 min later, tin(IV) chloride was added to the solution. At last, after another 30 min, 0.149 g of Si-CHA seeds was added and then the mixture was stirred for another 3 h prior to the synthesis (the seed step is essential for getting a crystalline product no crystalline phase was found when the stirring ran for less than 3 h). The final batch composition was  Si:33-446Me-1:0.2-0.5TPAOH:20.0H2O.
EuMOF (40 mg) was dispersed in ethanol (4 mL), and PVP (80 mg) was dissolved in ethanol (1 mL). PVP alco hol solution was added drop by drop into EuMOF solu tion, stirred by magnetic force at room temperature for 4 h, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min, washed with anhydrous ethanol for 3 times, and freeze-dried to obtain white product. Weighed 20 mg of the above products and dispersed them in 10 mL methanol, added 1 mL of Zn(NO3)3·6H2O (0.27 mol/mL) methanol solu tion, stirred for 10 min, added 3 mL of 2-MI(0.65 mol/ mL) methanol solution, stirred at room temperature for 6 h.

In brief outline, the FA (3 g) was mixed with 3 M NaOH solution and held at 90 °C for 3 h with stirring. Then, sodium metasilicate pentahydrate was mixed into the FA suspension to obtain an initial ­ SiO2/ Al2O3 molar ratio of 24.
0.8 g of P123 and 1 g of SDS were dissolved in 250 mL of H2O, followed by addition of a certain amount of Y precursors; H2SO4 was used to adjust the pH value of the mixed gel in the range of 1.5−1.8. In these gels, the weight ratio of SiO2/P123 was 5. Then the mixed solutions were assembled for 20 h at 30 °C. After that, the obtained products were transferred into Teﬂon autoclaves for crystallization at 100 °C for 48 h. After ﬁltration, washing, and drying, the as-synthesis products were calcined at 550 °C for 5 h to remove the P123 and SDS.
Calculated amounts of sodium aluminate, silicic acid, sodium hydroxide, tetrapropylammonium bromide, and deionized water were mixed together to form a gel under fast stirring for 3 h.

Crystallization was carried out at 180 °C under autogenous pressure for 48 h without stirring in stainless-steel Teflon lined autoclaves. After this crystallization step, the produced solid was recovered by filtration and washed several times with deionized water until the pH value of the decanted water reached 7. The final product was dried overnight at 105 °C and calcined in a muffle furnace under air flow at 530 °C for 12 h with heating rate of 3 °C min−1 to remove the organic template and water trapped within the micropores of the solid.
